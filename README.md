# Favorite-Movie-Tracker
This project is to help users keep track of their favorite movies.
When a user adds a movie to favorites he can then see the favorites menu to keep track of movies added to favorites.


I used the free API provided by TMDB to fetch the lastest movie data. 
I then created a separate card for each movie and arranged the cards to display it as a list. 
I used Ngrx to handle the data sharing between the movie component and Favorite component.
